WIP.

Continuing the theme of building software to play the games the kids
received or play around the holidays (see also
[here](https://github.com/Ethan826/golf_tee_game) and
[here](https://github.com/Ethan826/dreidel_rust)), this will play
Connect Four. (The common thread is that I have a little extra time to
fool around with this stuff during the holidays.)

I will use minimax with alphaâ€“beta pruning.
